# IAMY



With IAMY, you can configure your preferred parameters, and IAMY will generate LLM pipelines tailored to meet your specified target metrics Ð¸based on your labeled data.

For instance, consider two automatically generated checks compared to a baseline request (which includes only the description of the exercise) along with their corresponding precision and recall parameters:

  **Course 1**
| Requests| Precision|Recall|
|  --------  |  -------  |-------  |
| Baseline| 0.17 | 1
| IAMY | 0.98 | 0.84

  **Course 2**
| Requests| Precision|Recall|
|  --------  |  -------  |-------  |
| Baseline| 0.23 | 1
| IAMY | 0.95 | 0.41

## To start:
You require a small labeled dataset consisting of no more than a few hundred items.
